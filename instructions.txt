Hey, this is my project! It works on NodeJS.

To run it:

1 - run "node apm install" within the project folder just in case.
2 - "npm start" to start the server, then go to http://localhost:3000.

To add stories, just add them in the "stories" folder, following the model:
- Words to be informed by the user must appear between << and >> (the word's class must appear between those symbols).

Have fun!
